# Mind Mosaic
The repository serves as a collective canvas, showcasing the diverse, interconnected patterns of thought and machine ingenuity.

Learning without documentation is akin to acquiring knowledge that is easily forgotten. This repository represents my humble effort to create a comprehensive and readily accessible quick reference manual for revisiting concepts as needed.

The repository will also include some interesting projects I have realized using aforementioned building blocks. 

It is a work in progress.
